# ToDo:

- complete rai-python tutorials
  - JN 1: complete
  - JN 2: complete
  - JN 3: complete
  - JN 4: complete
  - JN 5 (Constrained Graph Optimiaztion): not working also difficult to get whats actually going on 
  - JN 6P (KOMO Physics): Not working but looks like also time optimization was also used 
  - JN 6S: not working also difficult to understand
  - JN 9:
  - sim1-physics: ?
  - lgp1-pickAndPlace: not working

- self coded example optimization problem with robot model?


- inform about double integrator model:


- implement double integrator model


# Meeting Notes from KW 49:

## KOMO specific:

- Why is the actual optimal position not reached every time? (is the optimization problem that difficult? Does the solver get stuck in local optima there?)

- nearly no optimization problem seems to be an feasible solution, often the eq or ineq terms are not zero/negative 

Till some degree acceptable, depending on the used weights

- how to decide which feature should be part of the sos, ineq and eq? It seems like they can often be all three types

- What is the time actually defining? -> Time points at which the feature is active but what is the over all time frame? Last timepoint that is specified? 

- how to choose solver/algorithm

- how to set up a kinematic model to use in komo (.g files ?)

- Is there any possibility to show the coordinate systems of the single frames?

## Model specific

 - what is the interface for the quadcopters? Do they need Torques/rotationspeed for every motor or just the trajectory which they should follow?

## General:

- What about literature research? Or is it more a practical Thesis?
