- complete rai-python tutorials
  - JN 1 complete
  - JN 2 complete
  - JN 3 complete
  - JN 4 complete
  - JN 5 not working also difficult to get whats actually going on
  - JN 6P not working
  - JN 6S not working also difficult to understand
  - JN 9
  - sim1-physics ?


- inform about double integrator model 
  - 


- implement double integrator model


# Meeting Notes from KW 49:

## KOMO specific:

- JN 3 (last example): Why does it states collisions 0 after the optimization problem is solved, if the robot arms are clearly intersecting and the coll (does the coll term relates to the collision in the first place?) term is greater than zero?

- Why is the actual optimal position not reached every time? (is the optimization problem that difficult? Does the solver get stuck in local optima there?)

- nearly no optimization problem seems to be an feasible solution, often the eq or ineq terms are not zero/negative 

- how to decide which feature should be part of the sos, ineq and eq? It seems like they can often be all three types

- What is the time actually defining? -> Time points at which the feature is active but what is the over all time frame? Last timepoint that is specified? 

- how to choose solver/algorithm

- how to set up a kinematic model to use in komo

- Is there any possibility to show the coordinate systems of the single frames?


## General:

- What about literature research? Or is it more a practical Thesis?
